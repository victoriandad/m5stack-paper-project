; [env:esp32dev]
; platform = espressif32
; board = esp32dev
; framework = arduino

; above is the default configuration for ESP32 development board
; below is the configuration for M5Stack Paper

; this is the same as the default configuration but with some extra flags and libraries
; to support the M5Stack Paper display and other features
; the M5Stack Paper is a development board with a 4.7 inch E-ink display
; and a built-in ESP32 microcontroller
; it is used for various applications such as e-book readers, smart displays, etc.
; the M5Stack Paper is a low-power device that can run for weeks on a single charge
; it has a built-in battery and can be charged via USB-C
